# FFXI-Oniji-Maps
These maps are meant as a supplement to Remapster maps and are not meant as a replacement or substitutes. They are modifications of existing known maps, but with additional labelling. In most cases the maps included here were just so that I didn't have to resort to opening a wiki to get to where I wanted to go.

Full Credit goes to original authors of these maps, including:
Remapster (https://remapster.com/)
FFXI Atlas (Nexus1203)
Please support their work.

Ashita Installation (Recommended):
- Install the addon XIPivot (for easily handling DAT swapping) - https://github.com/HealsCodes/XIPivot
- Download the ROM folder from this repository
- Follow the instructions on the XIPivot repository to install my maps (https://github.com/HealsCodes/XIPivot/tree/master/XIPivot.Ashita/resources)
- If you are using remapster and want these maps to appear in place of them, ensure that the folder for these map DATs appear higher than the remapster ones.
