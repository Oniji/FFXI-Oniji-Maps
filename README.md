These maps are meant as a supplement to Remapster maps and are not meant as a replacement or substitutes. It currently only includes Sky Maps with paths and labels. 

Installation:
- Download the ROM folder and all it's contents
- Either use XIPivot (preferred) or overwrite the existing DATs in your FFXI installation folder. (Ensure you make backups if you intend on overwriting your game files).
- If you are using XIPivot, ensure that the order of these maps is above remapster and any other map addons.
